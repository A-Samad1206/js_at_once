Initially JS was used to to little scripting tasks,
but as 

Modules - Encapsulate the code, means code within one Modules   
    is not accessible from other modules unless not imported.
- This prevent naming conflict and better code struucture.

- Export - Allow to export variable, functions, classes etc.
- Two types of exports 
    - Named exports
    - Default exports

- A modules can have multiple named exports but have only one default export.

- Import  - Allow to bring exported value from a mentioned modules.
 - importing named exporting - by enclosing in {}, mentioning the exact named
    exported modules named exportef values
    - Can rename these 
 - import default value - 
 - Namespace importing - 
    - It import all named export and default exports


Dynamic modules loading - Allow to import modules when needed.
Use case
import("moduleSpecifier") return a Promise that resolve to when modules is loaded 
succeffully or reject if not loaded.
- Loading modules on demand
- Loading based on cnondition
- Computed modules specifier - Locales

let greeting = await import('./greeting.js');
greeting.default();
